## Lessons Learned

Building this calculator application deepened my understanding of Visual Basic and Windows Forms development. I improved my skills in designing intuitive user interfaces and handling user input effectively.

One challenge was managing error handling for invalid operations such as division by zero, which I resolved by implementing validation logic to provide user-friendly error messages.
